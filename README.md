## Guess the Number (Java)
A random number is generated for each instance of the game. The goal is to deduce the random number using the hints provided. Inspired by [@blondiebytes](https://github.com/blondiebytes).
Writing the game is an exercise in the following:
- Creating a non-static class with variables, a constructor and methods.
- Java's Random class and it's nextInt() method.
- Using Random within a constructor to customise each instance of the game.
- Using (modulo % max + 1) to set a limit on random number generation.
- Creating an instance and calling a method
- Writing Java in Visual Studio Code *because it's light on resources* and easy to push to GitHub directly.
